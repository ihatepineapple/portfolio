                <p>My name is Irene Asensio. Iâ€™m from Barcelona, and have been living in Amsterdam for almost 8 years. 
                I recently did a career switch from Graphic Design to Web Development. I could define myself as creative and responsible. 
                I am a problem solver but also very empathic- I always try to check all sides of a problem from different angles to approach 
                the best solution.</p>
